# S-DeepONet
A sequential DeepONet model implementation that uses a recurrent neural network (GRU and LSTM) in the branch and a feed-forward neural network in the trunk. The branch network efficiently encodes time-dependent input functions, and the trunk network captures the spatial dependence of the full-field data.
